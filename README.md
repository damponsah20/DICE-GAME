A simple Python script for a dice game where players roll a die, and the first to reach a maximum score wins. 
Here's a summary of what the code does:

Player Input: The game starts by asking for the number of players (between 2 and 4).
Rolling Dice: Players take turns rolling a die. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends without adding any points. Otherwise, the rolled value is added to their current score.
Winning Condition: The game continues until a player's score reaches or exceeds the maximum score of 50.
